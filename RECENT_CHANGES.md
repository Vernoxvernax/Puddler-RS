* emby now prints series and movies in the latest section (limited to 10 entries each)
* fixed printing when a played episode/special is shown at "continue-watching" (yes this can happend)
* specials can now appear in the "play-next" prompt after finishing an episode
* discord presence actually turned off (paused state wasn't blocked)
* the codec field can apparently be undefined -> fallback to "???" added
